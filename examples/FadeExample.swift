// FadeTransition.swift for the custom transition implementation.

    // The transition controller is an associated object on all UIViewController instances that
    // allows you to customize the way the view controller is presented. The primary API on the
    // controller that you'll make use of is the `transition` property. Setting this property will
    // dictate how the view controller is presented. For this example we've built a custom
    // FadeTransition, so we'll make use of that now:
    modalViewController.mdm_transitionController.transition = FadeTransition(target: .foreView)

    // Note that once we assign the transition object to the view controller, the transition will
    // govern all subsequent presentations and dismissals of that view controller instance. If we
    // want to use a different transition (e.g. to use an edge-swipe-to-dismiss transition) then we
    // can simply change the transition object before initiating the transition.
